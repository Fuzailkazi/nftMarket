# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract.

I build this project using NextJS as the frontend library and used tailwind css to style components of the webpage.
I coded the solidity smart contract using ERC 721 Token standard and tested the smart contract using hardhat.
A user can upload his NFT to the IPFS and tokenize it into an NFT and later he/she can put the NFT to sale if the will to, later if the change their mind before their listed NFT is sold they can cancel the listing and the NFT will be displayed on their account. 

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js
```
